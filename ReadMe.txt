The goal of this project is to provide some examples of the C# code required to use SQL Server Reporting Services without a report server.
The report is NOT fancy as showing the features of SSRS is not the goal of this project. 

Examples use data provided by the "DataAccess" library
(this is made up in this trivial example but could easily come from a database)

Data passed to the report is an IEnumberable<T>

ClientSideReporting - Windows Forms app
Example 1: open a screen with the full report viewer control
Example 2: generate report with custom UI

Future Plans:
Example using ASP.NET WebForms
Example using ASP.NET MVC
Example using WPF
