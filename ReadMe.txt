The goal of this project is to provide some examples of using SQL Server Reporting Services without a report server.

Examples use data provided by the "DataAccess" library
(this is made up in this trivial example but could easily come from a database)

Data passed to the report is an IEnumberable<T>

ClientSideReporting - Windows Forms app
Example 1: open a screen with the full report viewer control
Example 2: generate report with custom UI
